## Features

The app shows individual timeblocks for working hours (8am to 5pm).
It also shows the current time and date.
Users will be able to type within the timeblocks any task, and by clicking the save button on the right, the event(s) will be saved and stored in the Local storage.

- The app has different color timeblocks: red for the past, blue for the present, and green for the future.
  - The timeblocks are updated each second, and once the timeblock becomes past, it changes color automatically.
- The app displays the current date and time leveraging DayJS, in the format of date, month, year (2 digits), hours, minutes, seconds (am/pm).
  - The user is shown their relative time and date.
- Events entered (and saved) are saved in the local storage.
 - Once an event is saved in local storage, refreshing the page, or even closing and reopening, won't have the events disappear.
